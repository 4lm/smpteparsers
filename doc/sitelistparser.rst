SiteList Parser
================================

The SiteList Parser parses an flmx feed object, transforming the xml into a python object and providing some simple methods to help obtain the data from said that object


.. Should probably change this in the future to not automodule - maybe autoclass is okay but we probably want a bit more control over ordering and what is actually displayed
